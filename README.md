# Learn Phaser
This document will contain tutorials on Phaser related topics. The different demo projects will be organized in different branches. The main branch will contain a starter project with phaser and typescript. This branch will explore multiplayer with the colyseus package.

## Phaser 3 Multiplayer Demo
In this section we will create a demo multiplayer project with phaser 3 and colyseus. This section will use the template code from the [main branch](https://github.com/szhu321/phaser-demo/tree/main). If you do have have a starter project yet with phaser and typescript, head there to see how you can set one up. I will be using [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my IDE of choice.

### Getting Colyseus
In this demo we are going to make use of the colyseus package with contains functionality for clients to connect to rooms on a server.
